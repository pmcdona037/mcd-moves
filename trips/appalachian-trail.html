          Hello and welcome to the trip recap and report for my Appalachian Trail section hike through Vermont and Massachusetts. I started in Hanover, New Hampshire on September 5, 2025, and finished in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on September 14, 2025. The official start time was 10:15pm in Hanover, and I wrapped up at 9:58am in Great Barrington, finishing in just under eight days and twelve hours, despite spending nine nights on the trail. Through this recap, I’ll walk through the logistics, mileage, stats, and other details from the hike.

          Was that good enough? Probably not. I could’ve waxed poet about my love for Vermont and how I’d been dreaming of doing something like this for years. Or how this trip was originally intended to be a trip on the PCT and JMT in California. But who cares? I like long-distance backpacking, Vermont rules, and California would’ve been a smoke-filled web of logistical nightmares. So, Vermont it was and the all-too-familiar white blazes charted my course through the woods. Let’s dive in.

          The trip began in New York City. I worked a normal day for my normal job in my normal apartment, passed a bunch of normal people to walk to a normal block in Midtown, and left the normalcy behind as I boarded the Dartmouth Coach bus up to Hanover, New Hampshire. It left at perfect time to hit the worst of Friday New York City traffic, 4:30pm, and pulled into Hanover around 10:10pm that evening. I watched Moneyball on the ride, which was a lot better than I remembered, chatted with the bus driver, and sat with my thoughts on the trip to come. I mentioned this in my previous trip report, but I’m a big believer in using public transit to start the trip. It zaps you into this place of shocking vulnerability. You know you’re getting further and further away from your comfort zones, the people you love, and the familiar, and that intensifies the entire experience. Anyways, as far as long bus rides go, this one was pretty good.
