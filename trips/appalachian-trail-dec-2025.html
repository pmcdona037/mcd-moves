I’ll keep this one a bit punchy as it was a short trip.
</p>
<p>
My brain had been curling over itself for years with the thought of finishing Georgia on the Appalachian Trail. I had a failed section hike in 2023 where a bad experience with a problematic person, featuring a laser pointer in the middle of the night, forced me off trail with only 26 miles remaining. This obviously left a sour taste in my mouth and overwriting the experience with a good, fresh memory was top of mind. Plus, growing up in Georgia made finishing the state an easy call, especially with the trail being a short drive away.
</p>
<p>
So, I packed my bags in late-December and made my way up to North Georgia after softening (and fattening) up in the post-Christmas haze with my family in metro Atlanta. The drive was a little under two hours to get to the sad, gravel parking lot at the top of Unicoi Gap, where just two and a half years prior I silently sat waiting for a ride. Visions of a stressed out, exhausted version of myself called over from the shaded nook in the corner of the lot as I pulled up. That nook might have been confused by the mean snarl that it received, but I promise that it wasn’t personal. Before I knew it, I was out of the lot, and the North Carolina border was calling for me.
</p>
<p>
I started in the late afternoon and was racing the sun’s descent to the horizon to get some mileage for the day. After 7.5 miles, I found a flat spot on a saddle on Steeltrap Gap and set camp for the night. Going into this trip, I knew that it was going to be chilly. Not only this, but because I was home for the holidays, my gear set up was a bit strange with a hodgepodge of random equipment and apparel. To set the scene, I have a torso length pad, no stove, a 22-degree quilt, and random cold weather gear that ranges from top-of-the-line specialty fabrics to grocery produce bags. With that in mind, North Georgia decided that it’d be a great night to kick up wind gusts to 40-50 mph and to bring the temperature into the mid-teens. I slept in all my clothes and had to create a wall of leaves to block the drafts from cutting under my tent.

Morning finally arrived after a long December night that was spent doing periodic sit-ups just to stay warm. The internal battle to peel myself out of the sleeping bag was intense as the temperature remained stubbornly low as I broke camp under a cloak of darkness. As is my custom, I began hiking by headlamp, the beam carving a small, solitary cone of light out of the woods. Eventually, the sun lit the sky and the mercury began its slow, steady climb. Now is a good time to call out the fact that this was an impromptu trip where I hadn't done too much research beforehand. I’d heard the trail community call Georgia a "dream-crusher" for new thru-hikers, with North Georgia earning the reputation of being surprisingly steep, defined by constant undulations. But, I like going up and down, and luckily for me Georgia delivered with one climb after another. 
</p>
<p>
My only real goal for day two was to hit the border. With the yo-yo style of the trip, the objective was pretty simple. It was 26 miles from where I parked to the border and 26 miles back to the car. I’m no math whiz, but after a 7.5 mile day one, I had 18.5 miles set as the minimum mileage goal for the day. But where’s the fun in a low mileage day? Plus, I was in Georgia to be home with my family, so I couldn’t draw out my time in the backcountry. That brought me to the idea of walking until it gets dark again and wherever I end up, I’ll throw down my tent and call it a night. So, on the last day of 2025, I made it to the Georgia/North Carolina border on the Appalachian Trail, took a few steps into North Carolina, decided that was enough, and turned back around for the car. The rest of the day was simple. I soaked in the beauty of the trail while reflecting on an incredible year filled with adventure, love, and gratitude. Being close to the winter solstice, the sun didn’t want to stay out for too long and before I knew it, I was on the prowl for a campsite. After the sun took its final bow for the year, I pulled over to Deep Gap Shelter and made camp.
</p>
<p>
Arriving at the shelter, I heard a man on the phone and could hear the fear in his voice. Loud footsteps past sunset are always unnerving, but after I revealed that I was not a serial killer or a bear, he relaxed. A solo male hiker stood before me with his dog and over 50lbs of gear scattered around the site. I can’t remember his name, maybe “Kitchen Sink” will do, but this trip was incredibly symbolic for him. He had lost over 200lbs over the past two years, beaten depression, and set a goal to go from Deep Gap to Amicalola Falls. Here he was before me in the North Georgia mountains proving that he could take on this challenge. Aside from hearing his story and offering advice where it was welcomed, I could tell he felt at ease with having a more experienced hiker at his site for his first night alone in the backcountry. To me, it served as a full-circle experience. I remember my first night solo in the backcountry and the footsteps and coyote calls that threatened to fray my nerves. So, to be a proverbial security blanket for somebody stepping out and doing this for the first time was a nice touch. My poor planning and lack of clothing finally caught up to me. Shivering, I bid safe travels to 'He-Who-Shall-Be-Named Kitchen Sink' and made a beeline for my tent.
</p>
<p>
That night at Deep Gap Shelter was New Years Eve and was punctuated by the pop of distant fireworks ringing through the dark, quiet mountain silhouettes. As I sat in my tent, I felt so grateful how I was ending the year exactly where I wanted to be, not in a crowded bar or club, but deep in the backcountry with a sunrise waiting for me the next morning. 
</p>
<p>
I slept almost too good as the alarm didn’t get me up on the first try, but I broke camp and made it to the top of a ridge for the first sunrise of the new year. That next morning was chilly again, but the hiking was easy and before I knew it, I was on the last decent back down to the truck. 52 miles in the bag, Georgia complete, and gone barely long enough for my family to realize it. It was the right trip, at the right time. 
</p>
<p>
Before I knew it, I was back home. Helping my sister nurse a hangover, letting the dog out, and proving to my Mom that I, in fact, survived. To nobody’s surprise, the world didn’t change and 2026 was in full swing. In fact, the duality of my life was playing out as plainly as ever as I emerged from the woods of North Georgia and shortly after arrived in a perfectly manicured suburban neighborhood. I spent under 48 hours under the open sky but, as always, life felt faster upon my return. The speed of the cars, the constant buzzing of technology and opinions, the frenetic pace of modernity, all just racing, racing, racing. Coming back into this part of my life, I’m always reminded how foreign “normal” feels to me. All I do is crave the “real” life that I live where time is slow, thoughts are endless threads to be unraveled at their own pace, and the rhythms of mind and body flow with the land under and around my feet. 
</p>
<p>
This is why I love backpacking and why it is such a large and growing part of my life. I connect with people, communities, the land, the ecosystems, the animals, and myself in a way that is wholly impossible to me in the modern world. There isn’t anybody telling me what to think or experience, rather I’m rewiring my brain on my own terms. To me, it doesn’t matter that people won’t understand why I do these things. Why I would go out on New Years Eve or when it’s too cold for the gear that I have. Why I make decisions in other parts of my life that allow more flexibility to have these experiences. The questions are always the same: why not make more money; why not do something easier; why would you want to be uncomfortable; why not do something more productive; do you carry a gun? They are missing the point entirely. I do this because I love it. Not to make money, not to be more productive, not to brag about it. Genuine, deep love. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine a world where everybody put that feeling at the top of their priority stack.
