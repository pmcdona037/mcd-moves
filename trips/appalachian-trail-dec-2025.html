I’ll keep this one a bit punchy as it was a short trip.
</p>
<p>
My brain had been curling over itself for years with the thought of finishing Georgia on the Appalachian Trail after a failed section hike in 2023. Having a bad experience with a problematic person on trail and having to get off really left a sour taste in my mouth and I wanted to overwrite the experience with a good, fresh memory. Plus, Georgia is my home state and the fact that one of the most prominent long-distance trails in the world begins there, made the decision to hike the entire trail within the state easy.
</p>
<p>
So, I packed my bags in late-December and made my way up to North Georgia after reveling in the holiday bliss with my family in metro Atlanta. The drive was a little under two hours to get to the sad, gravel parking lot at the top of Unicoi Gap, where I silently sat on the road waiting for a ride just two and a half years prior. Before I knew it, I was out of eyesight of the truck and the North Carolina border was calling for me.
</p>
<p>
I started in the late afternoon and was racing the sun’s descent to the horizon to get some mileage for the day. After 7.5 miles, I found a flat spot on a saddle on Steeltrap Gap and set camp for the night. Going into this trip, I knew that it was going to be chilly. Not only this, but because I was home for the holidays, my gear set up was a bit strange with a hodgepodge of random equipment and apparel. On comes night one, I have a torso length pad, no stove, and random cold weather gear, and North Georgia decided that it’d be a great night to kick wind gusts up to 40-50 mph and to bring the temperature into the mid-teens. I slept in all my clothes and had to create a wall of leaves to block the drafts from cutting under my tent.

Morning eventually came after a night of sit-ups at periodic intervals to remain warm and the temperatures were still brutally low with the sun still hiding behind the cloak of darkness. As is customary with my walks, I broke camp and started moving with the assistance of a headlamp creating a nice little cone for me to see a tiny sliver in front of me. Eventually, the sun lit up the morning sky and the mercury began its slow, steady climb. I didn’t do much research before heading out on the trip regarding the terrain, but North Georgia is surprisingly steep with several climbs that clearly bring new thru-hikers to their knees as part of the annual spring tradition. But, I like going up and down, and luckily for me day two was speckled with one climb after another. 
</p>
<p>
My only real goal for day two was to hit the border. With the yo-yo style of the trip, the objective was pretty simple. It was 26 miles from where I parked to the border and 26 miles back to the car. I’m no math wiz but after a 7.5 mile day one, I had 18.5 miles as the minimum for the day. But where’s the fun in a low mileage day? Plus, I was in Georgia to be home with my family. That brought me to the thought of walking until it gets dark again and wherever I end up, I’ll throw down my tent and call it a night. So, on the last day of 2025, I made it to the Georgia/North Carolina border on the Appalachian Trail, took a few steps into North Carolina, decided that was enough, and turned back around for the car. The rest of the day was simple. I soaked in the beauty of the trail while reflecting on an incredible year filled with adventure, love, and gratitude. Being close to the winter solstice, the sun didn’t want to stay out for too long and the total mileage I could put down was limited. After the sun took the final bow for the day, I pulled over to Deep Gap Shelter and made camp.
</p>
<p>
At the shelter was a solo male hiker with his dog and the trail name “Kitchen Sink” would’ve been applicable here with over 50lbs of gear scattered around the site. I can’t remember his name, but this trip was incredibly symbolic for him. He had lost over 200lbs over the past two years, beaten depression, and set off solo through the North Georgia mountains to prove that he could take on this challenge. I could hear him on the phone with his wife as I walked up to the shelter and could hear the fear in his voice about footsteps in the dark, but after I revealed that I was not a serial killer or a bear, he relaxed and felt at ease with having a more experienced hiker at his site for his first night alone in the backcountry. 
</p>
<p>
That night at Deep Gap Shelter was New Years Eve and was punctuated by the pop of distant fireworks ringing through the dark, quiet mountain silhouettes. As I sat in my tent, I felt so happy thinking how I was ending the year exactly where I wanted to be, not in a crowded bar or club, but deep in the backcountry with a sunrise waiting for me the next morning. 
</p>
<p>
I slept almost too good as the alarm didn’t get me up on the first try, but I broke camp and made it to the top of a ridge for the first sunrise of the new year. That next morning was chilly again, but the hiking was easy and before I knew it I was on the last decent back down to the truck. 52 miles in the bag, Georgia complete, and gone barely long enough for my family to realize it. It was the right trip at the right time. 
</p>
<p>
Before I knew it, I was back home. Helping my sister nurse a hangover, letting the dog out, and proving to my Mom that I, in fact, survived. 2026 was in full swing with the duality of my life was playing out as plainly as ever after emerging from the woods of North Georgia to a perfectly manicured suburban oasis. I spent under 48 hours under the open sky but, as always, life felt faster. The speed of the automobiles, the constant buzzing of technology and opinions, the frenetic pace of modernity, all just racing, racing, racing. Coming back into this half of my life, I’m always reminded how foreign the “normal” feels to me. All I do is crave the “real” life that I live where time is slow, thoughts are endless threads to be unraveled at their own pace, and the rhythms of mind and body flow with the land under and around my feet. Of course, I love my family, friends, and loved ones and with that comes living in the modern world and being a part of modern society, but little jaunts like this point out the insanity that we all choose to live within and how easy and close we are to return to what is more natural.
</p>
<p>
This is why I love backpacking and why it is such a large and growing part of my life. I connect with people, communities, the land, the ecosystems, the animals, and myself in a way that is wholly impossible to me in the modern world. There isn’t anybody telling me what to think or experience, rather I’m rewiring my brain on my own terms. To me, it doesn’t matter that people won’t understand why I do these things. Why I would go out on New Years Eve or when it’s too cold for the gear that I have. Why I make decisions in other parts of my life that allow more flexibility to have these experiences. The questions are always the same: why not make more money; why not do something easier; why would you want to be uncomfortable; why not do something more productive. They are missing the point entirely. I do this because I love it. Not to make money, not to be more productive, not to brag about it. I think our society could use a little dose of this attitude to start climbing out of the hole that we’ve dug for ourselves.
